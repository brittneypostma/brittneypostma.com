    text: `<p>As a Design System Architect, I specialize in building scalable, robust systems that empower product teams to design and develop with consistency, efficiency, and clarity. I bridge the gap between design and engineering by creating component libraries, defining token strategies, and establishing guidelines that ensure brand alignment across platforms. My work focuses on solving real-world problems through system architecture, enabling teams to ship faster without sacrificing quality. I advocate for accessibility, maintainability, and collaboration at every layer of the system, from foundational tokens to complex UI patterns.</p>`,

    title: "teacher",
    text: `<p>Whether I am leading workshops, creating courses, speaking at conferences, pair programming, reviewing pull requests, or just sharing best practices, I aim to enable others and create a supportive environment. I use PR reviews as opportunities to provide constructive feedback, explain design decisions, and guide others toward scalable and maintainable solutions. Mentorship is a natural extension of my role, I believe that helping others grow strengthens the entire team and leads to better, more thoughtful products. I have spoken on topics from design to development at leading industry conferences like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKJzrPA0DY&list=PL0XPnh5er_zVoZzcR4c93ELNKs8eNSS-4&index=16Web Unleashed</a> and <a href="https://cfe.dev/sessions/jamdev2022-svelte-magic/">The Jam.dev</a>.</p>`,
