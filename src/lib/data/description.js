    title: "developer",
    text: `I am a self-taught developer as a second career. I found my passion for coding after learning design and becoming a mom. While being a stay-at-home mom, I worked hard to learn and take in any information I could. I loved CSS, it felt like I was bringing my designs to life. And then I found my place in the Svelte community. I am a Svelte Ambassador, co-founder of the Svelte Sirens community, co-host of the Svelte Radio podcast, and contributor. I advised a Google workshop as a Svelte expert. I have been using Svelte for years and have been building with SvelteKit since it was initially launched in beta. I built a design system for CodingCat.dev and implemented it into Next.js with TailwindCSS. I worked for Grainger building out their design system in Svelte and then transitioning it to React. I was at Netlify as a Developer Experience Engineer where I worked closely with the Development Workflow Pillar in the developer experience of products while maintaining my presence in the community.`
