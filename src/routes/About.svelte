	<p>
		I'm Brittney Postma, the developer and designer behind bDesigned. I have a background in graphic
		design and more recently found my passion for coding. I taught myself through the
		<a href="https://academy.zerotomastery.io/?affcode=441520_gjue7n-1">ZTM Academy</a>
		while being a stay at home mom to my 3 wonderful kids. I am a star mentor in the ZTM Discord community
		and recently joined the other great instructors at the Academy. I did a live workshop on Responsive
		Web Design that is available to all Academy students now!
	</p>
	<p>
		I love developing beautiful, fluid, and responsive websites using new technologies. I thrive on
		accessible, semantic HTML that also has personality. I want everyone to be included on my
		websites, but also have some fun! I use Figma to create design systems, mockups, and clickable
		prototypes. User experience is extremely important to me and I strive to have a low user misery
		rating. I also use Photoshop like tools to create logos and high quality SVG icons and designs.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am passionate about UI/UX (User Interface and User Experience) development and SEO. I have
		extensive experience with frontend frameworks React/Gatsby and Svelte/Sapper on the
		<a href="https://jamstack.org/">Jamstack</a>. I have experience working with a wide range of
		technologies including Vue, React Native, Python, GraphQL, and SQL and NoSQL databases.
	</p>
	<p>
		I created my own VSCode theme,
		<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bDesigned.deep-water">Deep Water</a
		>, based on the colors of the ocean, and wrote about the process over at
		<a href="https://dev.to/bdesigned/build-a-vscode-theme-3f4i">dev.to</a>. I stream and record
		videos on
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyvOaBoW3Jti69U4Gw1ci9Q"> Youtube </a>
		and really enjoy teaching others all the awesome things I have learned. I started a digital garden,
		<a href="https://www.theconsolelogs.com/">The Console Logs</a>
		, as a place to keep all of my development notes. If you would like to get in touch, you can reach
		me at the socials below or
